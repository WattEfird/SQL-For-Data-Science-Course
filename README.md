Using Yelp restaurant database<br/>
Analyzed Yelp restaurants and their reviews using MySQL<br/>
Used JOINS, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, LIMIT, AVG, MAX, MIN, CASE, ALIAS<br/>
Also made inferences to draw conclusions and insights on specific restaurants and how to better predict if a restaurant was more or less likely to continue to receive good or bad reviews.
